Please repeat the Exploratory Data Analysis plotting part in the [Customer analysis Case Study](https://github.com/raafat-hantoush/IH_RH_DA_FT_MAY_2022/blob/main/Class_Materials/Case_Studies/Customer_Analysis_Case_Study/Activities.md) that you worked on in the previous labs. This time will use Tableau instead of using python plotting libraries. Please note that the activity titled <b>Plot the Correlation Heatmap</b> is optional.
