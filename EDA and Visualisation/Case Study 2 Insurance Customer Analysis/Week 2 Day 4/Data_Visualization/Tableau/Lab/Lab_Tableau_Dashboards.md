# Lab Tableau Dashboard

Using Super store Data set [Data](https://github.com/raafat-hantoush/IH_RH_DA_FT_MAy_2022/blob/main/Class_Materials/Data_Visualization/Tableau/Data/Sample%20-%20Superstore.xls), you are required to build a Dashboard using Tableau that gives better insight for the business executives about the overall performance of the business.

- latest year KPIs:
   - total profit
   - total sales
   - total discount
   - (optional):  show the YoY growth rate ( comparing the current measure with the prior year)
- show the quarterly sales over years
- show the quarterly profit over years
- optional: profit margin(%) drilled down by sub-category
- top 3 most profitable "corporate" customers. (Hint: check the option "add to context" on filters. This option tells Tableau that the "contextual" filter should be applied before any other filter).
- top 3 most profitable product sub categories in every region.
- (optional): show the return rate(orders returned) by sub-category by region
- (optional): any chart/s that you may think that can show an important insight/pattern about the business performance. 
- (Optional): The dashboard/s shows an option to filter the data by Region, Segment, Category, sub Category

The dashboard should have clean and well readable design. All charts have titles, labels etc. the dashboard should be tested on a desktop layout. You may decide to split the dashboard into two dashabords ( Executive, Operational(orders, customers, etc) if it is needed.
